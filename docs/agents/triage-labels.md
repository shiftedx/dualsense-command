# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of two category roles and five state roles. This file
maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

Every triaged issue should carry exactly one category role and one state role.
If state roles conflict, ask the maintainer before changing labels.

## Category Roles

| Role in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                 |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `bug`                     | `bug`                | Something is broken     |
| `enhancement`             | `enhancement`        | New feature or improved behavior |

## State Roles

| Role in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`            | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`              | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`         | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`         | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                 | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role, use the corresponding label string from this
table. For example, "apply the AFK-ready triage label" means applying
`ready-for-agent`.
